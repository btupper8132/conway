#Conway's game of life


##The rules:


>If a living cell is touching 2 or 3 other cells, it remains alive. Otherwise, it dies.


>If an empty cell is touching 3 cells, a living cell is born. Otherwise, it remains empty.


That's it! Preset, I have a spinner, a glider, and a 2x2 stable structure. See what happens!
